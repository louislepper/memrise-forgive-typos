#Note:
This is a fork of Raine Virta's MemriseForgiveTypos.user.js
He did all of the work, I've just made it take into account alternate answers.

# MemriseForgiveTypos.user.js

Shows an alert box ***once*** if the [Levenshtein
distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) of a given
answer and the correct answer is 1 or 2.

I'm not a big fan of making a hack like this but at the same time I don't
think you should be punished for accidental typos as Memrise currently does.
Use at your own peril.

I have tested the userscript on Chrome and Firefox using Greasemonkey.

2. Open [MemriseForgiveTypos.user.js][raw-script] and click **Install**.

### Method 2

2. Go to the extension view in Chrome ([chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)).
3. Drag the `MemriseForgiveTypos.user.js` file on the extension page. It should say "Drop to install" as you do so.

## Safari

I haven't tried. [Search Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+userscripts+safari) for ways to install userscripts.
